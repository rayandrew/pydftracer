# pydftracer

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pydftracer/badge/?version=latest)](https://dftracer.readthedocs.io/projects/pydftracer/)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
[![Python 3.9+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

A lightweight, typed Python interface for [DFTracer](https://github.com/LLNL/dftracer). 
Ideal for prototyping, testing, and iterating on code that uses the DFTracer Python API before deploying the complete tracing stack.

## Purposes

- Are prototyping applications that will eventually use full DFTracer
- Maintain DFTracer API compatibility in environments where tracing is not needed (e.g. production apps)

## Installation

```bash
pip install dftracer
```

## Development

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]

# Using Make (recommended)
make test-parallel       # Run all tests with parallel execution
make test-subprocess     # Run only subprocess-based dftracer tests  
make test-ci             # Run comprehensive tests matching CI configuration
make test-ci-quick       # Run quick tests and checks (faster)
make check-all           # Run all quality checks (lint, format, type-check, test)

# Using pytest directly
pytest tests/ -v -n 4    # All tests with parallel execution
pytest tests/ --cov=dftracer --cov-report=term-missing -v -n 4  # Tests with coverage
```

## Development

### Testing

This project uses a comprehensive test suite with subprocess-based isolation for proper dftracer testing.

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]

# Using Make (recommended)
make test-parallel    # Run all tests with parallel execution
make test-subprocess  # Run only subprocess-based dftracer tests  
make test-ci          # Run tests matching CI configuration
make check-all        # Run all quality checks (lint, format, type-check, test)

# Using pytest directly
pytest tests/ -v -n 2                                    # All tests with parallel execution
pytest tests/ --cov=dftracer --cov-report=term-missing -v -n 2  # Tests with coverage
pytest tests/ -m subprocess -v -n 2                      # Only subprocess tests

# Use the provided test script (matches CI)
./scripts/test.sh
```

#### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: General functionality tests in `tests/test_general.py`
- **Integration Tests**: Subprocess-based dftracer tests in `tests/test_dftracer.py`
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests run in parallel using `pytest-xdist` for faster execution
- **Process Isolation**: dftracer tests run in separate subprocesses to handle the per-process nature of dftracer

#### CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration with:
- Multi-Python version testing (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Parallel test execution with coverage reporting
- Code linting with `ruff`
- Type checking with `mypy`
- Package building and installation testing
